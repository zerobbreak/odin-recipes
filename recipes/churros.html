    <h1>Churros II</h1>
    <img src="../Images/churros.jpg" alt="Churros">
    <p>Churros are a type of fried dough pastry that originated in Spain and are now popular throughout many countries
        in Latin America and around the world. They are typically made from a simple dough of flour, water, and salt,
        which is piped through a star-shaped nozzle and then fried until crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.
        Churros are often served with a dipping sauce, such as chocolate or dulce de leche, and can be enjoyed as a
        snack or dessert. They are commonly served in long, straight sticks or in a coiled shape, and may be dusted with
        sugar or cinnamon for added flavor.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>½ cup margarine</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, combine the water, butter, sugar, and salt. Heat over medium-high heat until the
            mixture comes to a boil and the butter is fully melted.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and add the flour to the pan. Stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until the dough
            comes together and pulls away from the sides of the pan.</li>
        <li>Remove the pan from the heat and let it cool for 5-10 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, stirring
            vigorously after each addition until the dough is smooth and glossy.</li>
        <li>Heat a large pot or deep fryer filled with vegetable oil over medium-high heat until it reaches 375°F
            (190°C).</li>
        <li>Transfer the churro dough to a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip. Pipe the dough directly into the hot
            oil, cutting off the dough with scissors or a knife once it reaches your desired length (typically 4-6
            inches or 10-15 cm).</li>
        <li>Fry the churros until they are golden brown on all sides, turning occasionally with tongs to ensure even
            cooking. Remove the churros from the oil with a slotted spoon and transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate
            to drain any excess oil.</li>
        <li>If desired, coat the churros in cinnamon sugar while they are still warm.</li>
        <li>Serve the churros with your favorite dipping sauce, such as melted chocolate, caramel, or dulce de leche.
        </li>
    </ol>
