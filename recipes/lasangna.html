        Lasagna is a popular Italian dish consisting of layers of flat pasta noodles, meat or vegetable sauce, and
        cheese. The noodles are boiled, then layered with the sauce and cheese, and baked until the cheese is melted and
        bubbly. The sauce can be made with a variety of meats or vegetables, and the cheese is typically a combination
        of ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan. Lasagna is a hearty and comforting meal that is often served as a main
        course for family dinners or special occasions. It is a versatile dish that can be adapted to suit different
        tastes and preferences.</p>

        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375Â°F.</li>
        <li>Cook lasagna noodles in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and
            rinse with cold water, then lay noodles flat on a clean kitchen towel to dry.</li>
        <li>If using meat: In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook ground beef or Italian sausage until browned,
            stirring occasionally. Drain excess fat.</li>
        <li>Add onion and garlic to the skillet and cook until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, oregano, red pepper flakes (if using), salt, and black pepper to
            the skillet. Stir well and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring
            occasionally.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, mix together ricotta cheese, 1 1/2 cups of the shredded mozzarella cheese, Parmesan
            cheese, egg, and parsley.</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread a thin layer of sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange a layer of
            noodles over the sauce, then spread a layer of the cheese mixture over the noodles. Repeat layers until all
            ingredients are used up, ending with a layer of sauce on top.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese on top of the lasagna.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes or until the cheese is melted and bubbly and the
            lasagna is heated through.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna cool for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
